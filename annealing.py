# Problems 

# 1. Created a funcion called cost that returns the cost for a given solution. In this cae,
# the cost is given by Eq.(2)
# cost (solution)

# 2. Make a plot of the cost for solutions in the range -3 o 3, and identify a range for the
# optimal value.


# 3. Create a function that returns the a new solution given a possible one
# def neighbor (solution):
#	step_size = 1.0
#	return (2 * np.random.random() - 1) * step_size + solution 

# 4. Start with a randomly selected solution in the range found in step 4. FixT = 1 and Tmin = 10^-5


# 5. Generate a new solution with the function neighbor

# 6. Decide which of the two solutions is the best one based on what we discussed earlier (See Eq. 1)

# 7. Repeat steps 5 & 6 100 times

# 8. Decrease T by a factor of 0.9, and repeat steps 5-7 until the temperature drops below Tmin
